    "1. **Reconstruction**: A method for computing interface values $q^\\pm_{i - \\Delta x}$ from cell averages $Q_i$.  This involves some kind of limiting in order to avoid oscillations.  Higher-order reconstruction is often done using [weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)](http://www.dam.brown.edu/scicomp/media/report_files/BrownSC-2006-21.ps.gz) methods.\n",
    "2. **Numerical flux**:  An approximation of the flux, computed based on the interface values $q^\\pm_{i - \\Delta x}$.  The Lax-Friedrichs flux above is one of the simplest.  Much more accurate fluxes can be computed using an exact or approximate [Riemann solver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_solver).\n",
    "3. **Time integrator**: In order to get high-order accuracy in time, usually a [Runge-Kutta method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) is used.  [Strong stability preserving methods](http://www.davidketcheson.info/assets/papers/sspreview.pdf) are particularly popular.\n",
